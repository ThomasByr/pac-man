## ‚úèÔ∏è Setup

> **Note**
> This project is part of a M1 study done at the University of Strasbourg, France.

Please make sure you have `libsdl2` installed :

```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```

<details>
  <summary>  For Windows 11 WSLg users (click here to expand) </summary>
  Please make sure you have graphical x11 support installed:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libgl1 libxkbcommon-x11-0
  ```

</details>

Then compile a release version of the program with :

```bash
make release
```

The produced executable binary is to be found inside of the `bin` folder.

## üíÅ More infos and Usage

> **Warning**
> We use SDL2 as the only external dependency. Others dependencies are compiled from source (please see [lib](lib) folder). Note that if not specified, all files are written by @ThomasByr.
>
> Notable ones are :
>
> - ctpl.hpp, a C++11 header-only library for thread pools
> - ini.hpp, a single-file header-only library for INI files
> - json.hpp, a single-file header-only library for JSON (by Niels Lohmann)

## üß™ Testing

Oh god... please don't.

Still, make sure you have `valgrind` up and ready and then run :

```bash
cd tests && make check_quiet
```
