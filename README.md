## ‚úèÔ∏è Setup

> **Note**
>
> This project is part of a M1 study done at the University of Strasbourg, France.

Please make sure you have `libsdl2` installed :

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

<details>
  <summary> For Windows 11 WSLg users (click here to expand) </summary>
  Please make sure you have graphical x11 support installed (should be installed by default) :

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgl1 libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

Also, make sure `wsl --version` outputs at least the following :

```bash
WSL    Version : 1.2.5.0
kernel Version : 5.15.90.1
WSLg   Version : 1.0.51
```

If not, please update your WSLg version by following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-kernel#update-the-wsl-2-linux-kernel). tl;dr : type this in your powershell :

```ps1
# will only work if you have the latest Windows 11 update
wsl --shutdown
wsl --update
```

</details>

Then compile a release version of the program with :

```bash
make release
```

> To reduce compile time, you can use the `-j` flag to compile in parallel. For example, if you have 4 cores, you can use `make -j4 release` to compile in 4 threads.

This project uses the `-std=gnu++17` flag to compile and the produced executable binary is to be found inside of the `bin` folder.

## üíÅ More infos and Usage

> **Warning**
>
> We use SDL2 as the only external dependency. Others dependencies are compiled from source (please see [lib](lib) folder). Note that if not specified, all files are written by @ThomasByr.
>
> Notable ones are :
>
> - ctpl.hpp, a C++11 header-only library for thread pools
> - ini.hpp, a single-file header-only library for INI files
> - json.hpp, a single-file header-only library for JSON (by Niels Lohmann)

We provide a [makefile](makefile) to ease the compilation process. It is composed of the following targets :

- `make release` : compiles the program in release mode
- `make debug` : compiles the program in debug mode
- `make clean` : cleans the build directory and the binary
- `make run` : runs the program
- `make docs` : generates the documentation and opens it in your default browser

There would be more to it, but these are the basics. To build the documentation, you will need `doxygen` and `graphviz` installed :

```bash
sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz
```

The documentation is to be found inside of the `html` folder.

## üß™ Testing

Oh god... please don't.

Still, make sure you have `valgrind` up and ready and then run :

```bash
cd tests && make check_quiet
```

| future bug | bug that does not appear in the current version but will appear as soon as the corresponding feature is implemented due to current core logic |

- ~~target fps bypassed~~ (resolved by re-updating timers after each frame)
- pac-man speed is set to 1.0f (won't fix)
- first animation sprite depends on current frame count (won't fix)
- when ghosts go back to their home, they come out as frightened (future bug)

**todo** (first implementation version)

- [x] show pacman (v0.2)
- [x] show ghosts (v0.1)
- [x] implement pacman direction and collisions logic (v0.2)
- [x] implement ghosts tracking algorithms (v0.4)
- [ ] create levels, scores, lives and a save system
